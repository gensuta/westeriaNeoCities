      <p>Hello dear reader,</p>
      <p>It's been a while. Sometimes I get so caught up with things I forget about my talents. Like webdev, guitar playing, rollerskating.</p>
      <p>I haven't been rollerskating or even skateboarding all year. Too hot, too tired, too worried about injuring myself. I honestly haven't eaten enough these
        past few months so that probably adds to it. Sorry for the mini vent, it's just...been 7 months and. I've changed for the better, I have, but I'm still struggling
        and that's hard to deal with.
      </p>

      <p>I know I'll be ok. I'm grateful and so happy I'm still here with so many people I love. with so many <em>THINGS</em> I love.</p>
      
      <p>I've been doing LOTS of reading since getting to work takes an hour and change so I have 3 hours of reading a day basically.
        I've been wanting to create again. In all the art forms I love. Not all the art I create I want to share, but I want to write myself
        a little manifesto to remember <em>why</em> I create. I never want to lose sight of it again because 'oh I need money'. Because of community,
        family, and my own drive I will survive. To truly live, I want to make and do things for myself! Even if it ends up sucking, that's ok.
      </p>

      <p>What even is a manifesto?
      </p>


      <p>Until next time...</p>
