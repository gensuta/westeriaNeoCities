      <p>Good Afternoon.</p>
      <p>I've never really been much of a person to blog before.</p> 

      <p>Journaling I've done on and off practically my whole life, but I think having this blog might help me remember to journal more. Maybe it's strange I'm putting my thoughts 
        and feelings online, but this is my more personal site anyways. I think having it here could help someone someday maybe, or it'll just be another part of black, queer history. Like the memoirs before me.
      </p>

      <p>Anyway, I've been feeling really lonely as of late. Every weekend it seems like everyone has plans except me. Hanging out in friend groups I'm not a part of or with new partners
        or doing things I could join, but can't afford. (I'm very <em>very</em> poor at the moment. It sucks. This year sucks.) But that's besdes the point.</p>

      <p>The point is, I'm realizing I wouldn't feel so lonely if I had intentions going into my weekends. If I said, "I'm going to make plans with x friend" or "I'm gonna spend x hours at the skate park" or 
        "I'm going to take time to chip away at Persona 3 so I can <em>actually</em> beat the damn thing this year." I wouldn't feel lonely at all! I'd be so focused on my plans that 
        I wouldn't mind that my siblings always get to go out on Friday nights and that I'm alone in my apartment. It's not anger towards anyone btw, just very mild jealousy. 
      </p>

      <p>I think I miss having community. I've talked about it a lot in therapy the past month. I had a found family, like actually, and now everyone's moved away/moved on
        except a few folks I still keep in touch with. There's this group in NY called the Black Trans Liberation Kitchen and I've been meaning to go there. I think it could be
        good for me. But I'm scared. I'm shy, introverted, autistic, nerdy, just... I think I'm too hard on myself and that stops me from letting myself connect with people.
        Well, go out and connect with people. Once I'm outside actually, it's not so bad. I reflect afterwards, but in the moment I haven't been masking anymore and have been letting myself
        be myself. 
      </p>

      <p>I think to wrap up this entry I'll try and think of an intention for today. It's a very rainy, gloomy Sunday here in New York. I thought of blogging because of a note I got in Kind
        Words. My therapist is out until the start of October, so I've been using Kind Words to help me keep my cool. I asked how do people deal with loneliness and this specific person said
        that they're loneliness reflected how they were feeling socially. As in, if all their friends are dating except them, they'd feel more lonely than usual.</p>

      <p>Maybe this is unhealthy, and because of how awful this year has been I keep kind of isolating myself to not 'burden' others. So that's why I was like "Eureka! If I'm not thinking about what other people are doing
        because I'm so focused on my own premade plans, I won't feel lonely!" Hah. We'll see how that goes. </p>        
      
      <p>Until next time reader...</p>
