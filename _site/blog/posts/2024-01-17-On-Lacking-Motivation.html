      <p>Hello dear reader,</p>
      <p>I think it's funny I've been making these blog posts without actually pushing them anywhere.</p>
      <p>They're just here living on my computer until I take the time to design my website and make it look all nice
        and accessible and viewable on mobile devices.
      </p>

      <p>But all of that takes time. Time I don't have. It takes energy I don't have.</p>
      
      <p>I've been trying to get into a routine to get myself out of this depression. It's weird because the past two years I've been fine.
        That being said, the past two years I was pretty stable even if it meant I felt like I was taking on too much work. And now I have
        only one job because the second job I thought I had chose to not schedule me for work. God, it's been a whole month since I've been
        hired so I'm practially like, fired now right?
      </p>

      <p>To cope with everything, I've been doing lots of reading. I'm on a manga/graphic novel kick at the moment just because it's easier 
        and more fun for me, but I wish I could do something else sometimes. I was on a coding kick before the year ended actually. And then 
        suddenly, my motivation was gone. It disappeared and made coding feel like a job instead of something fun. <em>Poof!</em>
      </p>

      <p>My motivation for things tends to come and go. I can be doing really good with gamedev work and then I can't for months.
        'Tis the life of the mentally ill no? Sometimes I just can't move. But I have to, because I need to survive and I need money 
        and I want to be happy! I don't want to be miserable all the time.
      </p>

      <p>Early in 2020, some of the darkest moments of my life, I would "motivate" myself by beating myself up mentally. I couldn't get 
        out of bed without telling myself a slew of insults. It took years to stop doing it, but now I try to motivate myself by other means.
        Eat this banana and then you can have a jimmy dean! Finish this book and you can borrow that manga you've been meaning to finish! 
        Stay in bed and you can always do the work later! The work will always be there later. You can sleep. You don't have to get up everyday.
      </p>

      <p>I think, my lack of motivation is because I've been let down and I'm burnt out. I love coding still, and gamedev, and art!
        However...My body feels empty. My body needs food. My body is cold. My bills are unpaid. I lack the time to do what brings me joy.
        I'd always be motivated if I could just take care of myself. If I could let myself be taken care of. If people would understand
        I <em>AM</em> trying my best. It's just hard and I'm tired and I've tried everything and nothing's working.
      </p>

      <p>What motivated me to open up this .html file and start a blog entry? Well. I needed an outlet. And all the autobio manga
        I've read helped me feel not alone. If you feel frustrated and worried you're not doing enough. I think it's just society
        not working in your favor. We will get through this dear reader. Don't burn yourself out. Just remind yourself that you <em>ARE</em>
        trying your best.
      </p>

      <p>Until next time...</p>
