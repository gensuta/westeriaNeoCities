      <p>Whoa! I didn't realize it's been only a day since I last made a blog entry...I couldn't help, but open this because I had the urge to go on and on to my gf about it.
        But ( and again, this is me being mean to my noggin) I don't want to annoy her. I used to vent on my priv twitter but then I started tweeting, 'I need to make a neocities
        so I can just blog insted!' And here we are. Journaling to help with my goofy, mentally ill brain.
      </p>

      <p>I promise I won't come crying here everyday, I just had another 'urethra!' moment while playing a video game.</p> 

      <p>Despite the blog entry title, I'm not currently replaying Persona 4. I don't think that's something I'd really wanna replay anyways. I like it, I do, but
        in terms of replays, P1 or P2is is where I'd start.
      </p>

      <p>The reason for this title, dear reader, is because I was playing Project Sekai and this silly thing happens to me sometimes where I see a group of friends that truly
        (in my optimistic brain) feel like a close friend group. One that can go on for years and years and I just quietly yearn for it. It's why I liked Persona 4 Golden so much. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It was actually my first Persona game. I'd known nothing about it beforehand, but my little sib really <em>really</em> wanted me to play it!
