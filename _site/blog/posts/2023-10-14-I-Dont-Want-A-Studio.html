      <p>Hello dear reader,</p>

      <p>Funnily enough, I haven't been blogging as much. To be fair, some of my reflective writing feels too personal to upload to the internet so it lies dormant in my phone 
        until it's time for therapy. I think it's best that way.
      </p> 

      <p>Despite all the hardships I've been going through this year, I'm so grateful for where I am right now. Young, in love, and letting myself explore. I've let myself explore
        bit by bit through my life. Less so when I was younger because I had no one to really look up to until highschool. More and more queer people had come into my life, into my
        mind, and showed me what life could look like.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a bit as a kid I wanted to be a disney kid. I wanted to be a singer or have popularity and other stupid, meaningless bullshit. Mainly for the idea of having financial stability
        and partially because deep down I wanted to feel "normal" in society. I didn't care much about it later on and I had struggled a bit with it in college when realizing I'm not cis
        and I'm <em>definitely</em> not neurotypical. I strived for normalcy to not have to deal with people pushing they ideas on me for not being the norm. But that's ok. It's actually
        so beautiful and wonderful to be a weirdo! Cringe and free through and through!
      </p>

      <p>
       Today's post was made because of QGJam which started today! I'm listening to the second panel as I type this actually. Back in 2020, I got to talk to Marina from Analgesic productions.
       She actually made this wonderful blogging engine I'm usuing right now! <a href="https://zonelets.net/posts/2020-11-08-Quick-Start-Guide">Zonelets.</a> It's funny that I didn't even
       realize she made this until I was looking into how to style my blog and I was like!!! Marina!! Such a fan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, that talk in 2020. I was trying to figure out where I wanna be in the games industry. I draw, I write, I make music, I program. I'm all over the damn place and it's junior year
        so I need to stay put somewhere so I can find a job. I knew I wasn't going to start a company straight out of college. Every person who's talked about graduating from NYU and starting
        a studio has said don't do it. Also? I'm not that responsible and am easily overwhelmed AND have health problems. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Skate & Date hasn't been completed and I've been working on that shit since highschool!! Why? Because I'm poor, I overscoped, I burnt out, etc...
        So because there was a list of folks offering advice to black folks in 2020, I decided to reach out. I was terrified because I'm terrible at talking to people I look up to. I've gotten a lot better because of therapy and being on meds now, but back then I was screaming internally.
        But it went great! I wish I took the time to look more into <a href="https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/blog">Glorious Trainwrecks</a> but I'm glad I'm revisiting it now.
      </p>

      <p>
        I feel like back then I had a bit of a rigid view of what games I <em>should</em> be making. I thought it had to be polished, consumer/publisher focused or something made to 
        be shown places. That's how you survive while being a gamedev right? Being an academic and making thought provoking stuff or making games meant to be consumed/bought.
        But Marina helped me realize games can be messy. You'd think I'd know that by now because of all the talks I've consumed and the games I've played, but being in college 
        made me focus on what comes after. Even worse, my father had been pushing me since my senior year of high school to make my own company. That's just the kind of people my parents 
        have become after dealing with bs from jobs and capitalism. Don't work for the man, work for yourself. I thought about it and kept saying I'm not ready, and listening to 
        the talks today for QGJam makes me sure I'll never be ready. Not in a bad way, but in a making choices for myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to make weird games and create worlds with friends or solo or with cool groups of queer indie folks. I don't want to be the leader. I can be a mentor, a teacher (I am a teacher actually haha),
        a helper, an elder (eventually), but I do not want to be <strong>THE</strong> leader. It can be my idea but I want it to become our idea. I want to have fun and I don't want to worry
        about finances, marketing, and all that other business bullshit. I HATE business. I yearn for people to do what makes them happy and allow them to grow! I want to create 3D art without 
        thinking about monetizing it. I want to help create community not IPs. I'm so sick of watching how fucked the games industry is and how tired I am thinking about myself as some studio 
        entity. If I make a studio it will not be mine but ours. That's all I'm saying.
      </p>

        What a rant. All of my blog posts I'm not gonna go back and reread to fix. This isn't meant to sound good. This place is for me to word vomit and it'll be awkward and vulnerable and 
        cringe. But I don't care, this is my space and you may come and go as you like. Thank you for being on this journey with me. I hope you can find joy in your hobbies without having to 
        turn it into a money making machine.
